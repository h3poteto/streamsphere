//! Rheomesh is a WebRTC SFU library that provides a simple API for building real-time communication applications. This provides an SDK to help you build a WebRTC SFU server. Which means this doesn't provide signaling server, please create your own signaling server. And please use this for WebRTC SFU features.
//! [Here](https://github.com/h3poteto/rheomesh/blob/master/sfu/examples/media_server.rs) is an example SFU server for video streaming.
